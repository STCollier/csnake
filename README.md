# Snake Game (Made with C and SDL 2.0)
Snake is a classic video game from the late 70s. The goal is to navigate a snake and eat as many apples as possible without touching the walls or the snake’s body.

## Instructions

- Move the Snake with the <kbd>↑</kbd><kbd>↓</kbd><kbd>←</kbd><kbd>→</kbd> arrow keys.
- Press <kbd>esc</kbd> to exit the game.
- Press <kbd>Space</kbd> to pause/resume the game or start a new game when Game Over.

## Building
Before you can build this project, you will need to install **SDL 2** on your machine. It can be installed on macOS with Homebrew using the command.

```
brew install sdl2
```

Clone the repository and change into the **csnake** directory.

```
git clone git@github.com:tonymackay/csnake.git && cd csnake
```

Then run `make` or `make debug`.

Note: this project is part of a tutorial I am writing on Medium and so far it has only been tested on macOS Big Sur.
